1044					MYELOPROLIFERATIVE NEOPLASMS	Diagnosis is SM-AHNMD with AML, according to Utah collaborators: "aggressive systemic mastocytosis with non-mast cell clonal disease of CMML that evolved to AML; no evidence of EGR1, D7Z1, D7S486, or D20S108/ MYBL2 probes". Because AML evolved from CMML, diagnosed with "AML with myelodysplastic-related changes", although don't know prior chemotherapy status.
